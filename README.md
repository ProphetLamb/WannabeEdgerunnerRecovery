# Wannabe Edgerunner - Humanity Recovery

**Find me on [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/6330).**
**Help with localization effort is much appreciated**

Extends the [Wannabe Edgerunner](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/5646) mod, to recover humanity over time.

Best used with:

- [Pet your Cat](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/6198)
- [Ripperdeck](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2850)

## Features

Over time, humanity penalties inflicted due to murder slowly regenerates.

- Recover humanity throughout the day. Equipped cyberware reduces the recovery-rate proportionally to the number of slots filled. So that no humanity is recovered, when a certain threshold is reached. Below that threshold humanity degenerates.
- Knocking-out an opponent instead of killing them rewards humanity.
- Donating to a homeless person recovers humanity.
- Petting Nibbels recovers humanity. [WIP]

| Note                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| To save resources, the recovery is only applied once every minute. |

## Implementation details

Edgerunner lore states, that "laying off chrome" prevents Cyberpychosis. In the context of CP2077, this system interprets "laying off chrome" as emptying Cyberwear slots.

This mod provides a immersive and highly configurable experience of the regeneration.

### Recovery over time

The current regen or degen can be seen in the Cyberdeck/Ripperdoc screen.

![Degen](assets/ripperdoc-degen.png)
![Regen](assets/ripperdoc-regen.png)

Humanity recovery is calculated as a linear interpolation in two parts.

- If the **Cyberware load is higher than the threshold**, degens humanity proportional to the load over the threshold. Interpolates $$l \in [k,1] \rightarrow [0,-r]$$ where $l$ is the load, $k$ is the threshold (settings), and $r$ is the recovery rate (settings)

- If the **Cyberware load is lower than the threshold**, regens humanity proportional to the load under the threshold Interpolates $$l \in [0,k] \rightarrow [0,r]$$ where $l$ is the load, $k$ is the threshold (settings), and $r$ is the recovery rate (settings)

This is illustrated in the diagram below.

```
     thres
0 ---|------------- 1 load
|    /\
|   /    \
|  /        \
| /            \
|/                \
1 rate   -rate
```

Disabling adaptive recovery always uses the maximum recovery rate, positive or negative.

### Recovery on knockout

Humanity is recovered inversely proportional to the penalty incurred for the kill.

The amount of humanity recovered is given by the following equation. $$d / c ^ e$$ where $d$ is the dividend (settings), $c$ is the kill cost, and $e$ the exponent (settings).

A dividend of zero turns off recovery on knockout.

### TODO

- [ ] Fix bug where regeneration occurs on the game start screen, after load, before session start. [rn, circumvented by delay]
- [x] Prevent humanity regeneration during combat.
- [x] Add on screens when restoring humanity (like exp gained notifications)
- [x] Gain humanity when donating to the homeless
- [ ] Gain humanity upon certain quest completions (romance etc)
- [ ] Gain humanity when petting cats!
- [x] Add visual feedback when Cyberware load exceeds the threshold. (Tint humaniy bar red)
- [x] Add ru-ru local. Thanks to @Locked15 !
- [ ] Add cz-cz local
- [ ] Add it-it local
- [ ] Add jp-jp local
- [ ] Add pl-pl local
- [ ] Add pt-br local
- [x] Add zh-cn local. Thanks to @FelixGMo !
- [ ] Add zh-tw local
- [ ] Add es-es local
